                        <p>During my Codecademy Full Stack Developer course, I embarked on a project to create a website for the fictitious "Tea Cozy" company. This endeavor allowed me to put my HTML and CSS skills into action, with a dash of Flexbox expertise.

                            I structured the website using HTML, carefully choosing semantic elements to ensure accessibility and logical organization. A navigation menu, constructed with an ordered list and anchor tags, streamlined user movement between sections.
                            
                            In the CSS realm, I utilized a harmonious color palette, custom fonts, and captivating imagery to bring elegance to the "Tea Cozy" theme.
                            
                            Flexbox played a crucial role in crafting flexible, responsive layouts, adapting seamlessly to varying screen sizes. This project was a testament to my HTML and CSS capabilities, while introducing me to the power of Flexbox for responsive design.</p>

                        <p>In my Codecademy Full Stack Developer course, I crafted a handy HTML table cheat sheet webpage.
